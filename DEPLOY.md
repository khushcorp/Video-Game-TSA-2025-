1. Go to https://github.com/new

## Step 2: Push Your Code

Run these commands in your terminal (you're already in the right folder):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/retrobalance-game.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** (top right)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Under "Source", select **"Deploy from a branch"**
5. Select branch: **main**
6. Select folder: **/ (root)**
7. Click **Save**

## Step 4: Get Your Shareable URL

Wait 1-2 minutes, then your game will be live at:
